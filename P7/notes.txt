do_GET(self):
- get url with urlparse
-get arguments with parse_qs

THE BIG IF

    example:

    if path == "list_species"
    SERVER = "rest_ensembl_org"



   - to make a call to the esmebl api we need server, url( with endpoint) and params.

   - the server is always the same for every call, but the ensembl endpoint may change -> to solve the problem we
    make the endpoint an argument so it doesnÂ´t affect the whole code: conn.request("GET", endpoint + PARAMS)  -> like that

    the next things should be inside the elif == "/get":

       - to append a param we add in the def make_call the params as an arg def make_call(params, ...)
       params shoukd be &param1= a it should have an umpersum, params, a number, equal and value

       - params = "&number=" + str(n_sequence)
       ensembl_asnwer = make_call("/sequence/id", params)

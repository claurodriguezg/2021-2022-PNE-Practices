endpoint = after the slash
we are going to use the ping  endpoint
the important thing is at the bottom
we need to creat a string that represents the server, the endpoint and the params
(only the endpoint and the params change- in the params one at least we need the
string already written)
we don't need the port anymore because we are working on an external server
then, we are going to be taken to another server
the server don't have to be in the URL just endpoint + params
the server is just to connect
is trying to transform everything (string) to the corresponding type --> json.loads
gets the string converts it to the diccionary and if it's an int then it
converts it to the corresponding type. Therefore, if we write if data1['ping'] == "1" it wont
work because in the diccionary is written as an int

for ex 2 we need to change the endpoint and maybe the params
